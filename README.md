need fix problem with runtime ( js crash if use async await ) https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33527653/babel-6-regeneratorruntime-is-not-defined<br>

<hr>
if  you have problem with <em>npm install</em> and error <em>This version of npm is compatible with lockfileVersion@1, but package-lock.json was generated for lockfileVersion@0. I'll try to do my best with it!</code> use this command <em>sudo rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install</code>
