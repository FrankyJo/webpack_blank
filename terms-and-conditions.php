                    <p>The Company is a credit broker, and facilitates the connection of consumers interested in loan amounts between £100 and £5,000 with participating Lenders (the "Company's Services"). The Company is not a Lender or a loan provider, does not make loans or credit decisions, and does not provide financing directly to you. The Company is a free referral service through which interested consumers can connect with a network of independent, third party Lenders.

Any compensation the Company may receive is paid by the Lender for advertising services provided.

                    <p>The Company will present your Information to one or more of our Lenders based on their individualised criteria until such time as a Lender accepts your application, or your application is declined by all Lenders your Information is presented to. Upon acceptance, you will be redirected to the Lender’s website to complete the application process. You are under no obligation to accept the terms of a loan offer before signing any applicable loan documents with the Lender, and you may cancel the process at any time before such point. Read the terms of any loan offer carefully and consider obtaining independent legal and/or financial advice before accepting. </p>
                    <p>The Company does not endorse, recommend, or guarantee the loan availability, price, product, availability, rates, fees or any other loan terms of Lenders.

All loan terms are those of the Lender alone. The Lender is solely responsible for its services to you and your interactions with the Lender are subject to such Lender's terms, conditions and privacy policies. Please direct all questions, comments, or concerns involving your loan to the Lender. </p>
